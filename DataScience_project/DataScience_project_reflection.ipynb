    "# Artifact Reflection: DataStory Project (DataScience)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description and Purpose\n",
    "This artifact is a Datastory project I made during my senior year (Fall Semester) as part of my DataScience course. The point of the project was to create graphs & investigate/analyze it using what we had. I chose to investigate a fastfood dataset and analyzed it to inform people about the best fastfoods to have as a cheat meal. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to apply what we learned early on in the course like creating scatter plots, histograms etc & convey a point (presentation skills)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contribution to Overall Learning\n",
    "This project just let me showcase my early learning in DataScience but also test & show my presentation skills. I wasn't persuading anyone of my invesagation but informing people the data which shows obvious points. It help me try out matplotlib, numpy or pandas & put it in to work during this project which was fun and that made it huge for me during my overall learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative Development\n",
    "The development process had a few key stages. I started by picking any dataset I wanted to use for my project and tried to find different relationships to 1 column. I created 4 graphs to convey that fastfoods with certain amount of protein could be eaten as a cheat meal. Afterthat I presented in front of my class and informed them about this (me presenting/ telling the story).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Might Have Done Differently\n",
    "I would've wanted to use a different dataset preferably something in sports because it's relatable with many people and would be much easier to catch relationships between columns. Iâ€™m proud of the project just wish I was more calm while presenting and just overall be more chill/ look like I own the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps for Future Development\n",
    "I would use the new knowledge I learned from the Spring Semester in DataScience to up the customization in the graphs and make it cooler for the viewers, seaborn would help me accomplish this. I would like to use this skill and perfect it in college to secure a data analyst role in any industry but sports industry in particular would be pretty cool worker for a sports team & still doing thing you love."
