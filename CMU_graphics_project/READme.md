## Description and Purpose
This artifact is a game I tried to create in cmu graphics, this represents what I learned aside from the other computer science classes. The game I created or triied to create was tic tac toe. The goal of the project was to demonstrate my understanding of cmu graphics by building a game in cmu graphics. I chose this thinking it'd be a pretty easy doable task, turns out it's pretty difficult.

## Contribution to Overall Learning
Creating this game helped introduce me to visuals and ways to interact with on screen. I've never taken this class before but was open to learning. I learned to create objects with `rect()`, `circle()` etc, also functions like `onMousePress()` & more. It was an important part of my learning as a Computer Science minor because it helped me expand my knowledge and branch out to different things I've never done before.

## Iterative Development
I wanted to make a tic tac toe game as I thought it was easy and doable but up till now I've been struggling. making the start screen was simple and easy then making the grid & background was the next step. the hard part has been trying to make the game logic, based on feedback I'd use `playerturns` as a way to check every turn if there's a winner after every move. I'm also stuck debugging/fixing an issue, it seems the game is running in the background/ behind start screen so you can't really see it.

## What I Might Have Done Differently
Looking back, I would have coded my mismatch game from python and added more depth to it. However tic tac toe was a simple start for any beginner especially me in cmu graphics.

## Next Steps for Future Development
If I were to continue working on this artifact, I would start by creating various games like mini games/ games that everyone has played. This would result into a gamehub where you can find games within my gamehub and play games like tic tac toe, mismatch game and the pattern goes on. things I create are for a bigger purpose.
