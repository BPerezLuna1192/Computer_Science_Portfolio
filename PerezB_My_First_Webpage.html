    <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54252372971_bebb6a83c7_b.jpg" alt="Bron Breakker on the Raw Brand of WWE" width="160" height="200">
    <blockquote>
    <p>Bron Breakker is a standout wrestler due to his combination of impressive athleticism, natural charisma, and strong technical skills. Coming from a legendary wrestling family, he brings a powerful, agile style to the ring that captivates audiences. Bron Breakker’s character can be described as having a “dog” mentality, meaning he’s relentless, gritty, and never backs down from a challenge. His intensity in the ring reflects the "dog" mindset — he's always pushing forward, fighting with heart, and giving everything he has to overcome any obstacle. This "dog" mentality comes through in his hard-hitting style and his no-quit attitude, whether he’s facing bigger opponents or in the toughest situations.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>Dominik Mysterio has quickly proven himself to be a skilled wrestler thanks to his impressive in-ring ability and natural progression as a performer. He combines his high-flying style, inherited from his legendary father Rey Mysterio, with a newfound edge as a heel. Dominik Mysterio has become incredibly over as a heel in WWE, largely due to his compelling character development and the contrast he brings to his family legacy. As the son of Rey Mysterio, fans initially expected him to follow in his father’s footsteps as a babyface, but his shift to a bratty, arrogant persona has made him one of the most hated characters on the roster. His alliance with Judgment Day has helped amplify his heel status, allowing him to lean into his "entitled" attitude, disrespecting his father and other legends.</p>

     <h2 style="background-color:red;">How I got into Watching WWE/Wrestling?</h2>
     <p>I got into wrestling when I was about 7 years old, and at the time, John Cena was my absolute favorite. I enjoyed it but didn’t really understand what was going on—at that age, I just thought it was real wrestling. Then, I found out that wrestling was scripted, and honestly, I didn’t really care much after that. Fast forward to my mid-to-late teen years, when I came across a clip of Liv Morgan hitting her Oblivion finisher. It shocked me because it looked so real, and I was amazed by the fact that there was a story and dialogue involved. That’s when it clicked for me: WWE was like a reality TV show, but with wrestling added for extra flair. From there, I became instantly hooked and became a loyal fan of The Judgment Day, particularly Liv, Raquel, Dom, and the others. I found myself getting lost in the world of WWE, where I had to use my imagination to truly immerse myself in the characters and storylines. It wasn’t just about the moves in the ring—it was about building that connection to the drama, the rivalries, and the triumphs. On days when I don’t have school or homework, I watch old matches and storylines, diving deeper to understand the plots and make sure I’m not just a "fake" wrestling fan, but a real, dedicated one who can truly appreciate the art of the storytelling.</p>
