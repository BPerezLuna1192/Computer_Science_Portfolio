# Brian Perez-Luna – Portfolio Introduction

## About Me  
My name is **Brian Perez-Luna**, and I am a senior at **Inwood Early College High School**. I major in **Computer Information Systems** and follow a **Computer Science track**, learning both throughout my high school years. I've always loved sports and watch all kinds of sports as a kid but I also really liked technology and the idea of coding/ ability to protect or create things. As I grew up, realizing being a sports athlete isn't gonna be realistic I'd like to try from a different angle and squeeze through the tech industry.

## Career & Future Goals  
I’m passionate about building a career in **engineering** or **Information Technologies**, with a focus on:

- **Cybersecurity**  
- **Data Science & Analytics**  
- **Software Engineering**

One of my main goals is to combine these skills with my love for **sports**. There are exciting tech jobs in sports—like analyzing player performance with data, developing apps for fans, or protecting stadiums and teams from cyber threats. I plan to attend **City College** to continue building the technical and analytical skills I need for this path. Every project, certification, and opportunity I take on brings me one step closer to my goal.
